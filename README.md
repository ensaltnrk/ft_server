# Ft_Server

Observations : The best is to run the container with daemon off and detached (not usefull here but it's to kubernetes project)

# Description
This project serves as an introduction into system administration. It reveals the importance of using scripts to automate tasks, and the purpose behind using Docker and Docker containers. The aim of the project is to run a server on a Debian Buster OS inside a Docker container. The server must run WordPress, phpMyAdmin and MySQL.

‚Ä¢ You must set up a web server with Nginx, in only one docker container. The
container OS must be debian buster.

‚Ä¢ Your web server must be able to run several services at the same time. The services
will be a WordPress website, phpMyAdmin and MySQL. You will need to make
sure your SQL database works with the WordPress and phpMyAdmin.

‚Ä¢ Your server should be able to use the SSL protocol.

‚Ä¢ You will have to make sure that, depending on the url, your server redirects to the
correct website.

‚Ä¢ You will also need to make sure your server is running with an autoindex that must
be able to be disabled.
